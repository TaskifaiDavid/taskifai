# TaskifAI Personalized Sales Pitch - Custom Screen Recording Script

## Pre-Recording Research Checklist:
- [ ] Company name and industry
- [ ] Prospect's name and role
- [ ] Number of resellers (estimate from their website/LinkedIn)
- [ ] Specific reseller partners they work with (Sephora, Nordstrom, etc.)
- [ ] Recent company news/launches/expansions

## Personalized Opening Hook (0-30 seconds)
*"Hi [PROSPECT NAME], I'm [Your Name] and I recorded this specifically for you and [COMPANY NAME]."*

*"I noticed [COMPANY] works with [SPECIFIC RESELLERS - e.g., Sephora, Ulta, and several specialty retailers], and I wanted to show you exactly how we're helping [SIMILAR COMPANY/INDUSTRY] brands like yours eliminate the Excel chaos and get real-time insights from their reseller data."*

*"This should take about 5 minutes, and by the end you'll see exactly how this would work for [COMPANY NAME]."*

## The Problem We Solve - Personalized (30-90 seconds)
*"Now [PROSPECT NAME], I'm sure you're dealing with this at [COMPANY]: getting Excel files from [SPECIFIC RESELLERS] in different formats every month."*

*"Based on what I can see, [COMPANY] probably works with [ESTIMATED NUMBER] resellers, which means someone on your team - maybe in [DEPARTMENT - marketing/ops] - is spending hours every month just trying to make sense of all that data."*

*"And here's the thing - by the time you've cleaned it all up and can actually see the trends, it's already [TIMEFRAME] old. That's especially challenging for [INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC PAIN - e.g., "fast-moving beauty products" or "seasonal fashion items"]."*

*"I've seen [SIMILAR COMPANY EXAMPLE] struggle with exactly the same thing before we helped them automate it."*

## Your Personalized Solution (90-180 seconds)
*"So here's what this would look like specifically for [COMPANY NAME]. Instead of trying to get [SPECIFIC RESELLERS] to change their formats - which never works - we built AI that adapts to them."*

**Show the 3-step process with their data:**

1. **Secure Upload Portal for [COMPANY]**
   - *"[RESELLER NAME] uploads their data in whatever Excel format they currently use"*
   - *"[ANOTHER RESELLER] does the same - no training required, no format changes"*

2. **AI-Powered Data Cleaning**
   - *"Our AI automatically detects and normalizes [RESELLER A]'s format versus [RESELLER B]'s format"*
   - *"All your [COMPANY] data gets stored securely in our enterprise infrastructure"*

3. **Custom Dashboard for [COMPANY NAME]**
   - *"Your [DEPARTMENT] team gets dashboards built specifically for [INDUSTRY/PRODUCT TYPE]"*
   - *"You could ask: 'How are [SPECIFIC PRODUCT LINE] performing at [SPECIFIC RESELLER] versus last quarter?'"*
   - *"Or: 'Which [PRODUCT CATEGORY] should we push more inventory to [SPECIFIC RESELLER]?'"*

## Real Client Success Story (180-240 seconds)
*"Let me show you a real example. BIBBI Parfum was spending 2 full days every week organizing reseller data from their luxury fragrance retailers."*

**Show their transformation:**
- **Before:** Manual Excel processing, delayed insights, frustrated team
- **After:** Real-time dashboards, AI-powered insights, 95% time savings
- **Result:** Team now focuses on strategy instead of data cleanup

*"They went from spreadsheet chaos to instant answers in just 30 days."*

## Technology That Works (240-300 seconds)
*"Behind the scenes, this is enterprise-grade technology:"*

- **GDPR compliant and secure**
- **Handles any Excel format automatically** 
- **Supabase infrastructure for reliability**
- **AI chat interface for natural language queries**
- **Weekly automated reports and smart alerts**

*"But for your team, it just works. Upload data, get insights."*

## Personalized Investment & ROI (300-360 seconds)
*"Now [PROSPECT NAME], let's talk about what this investment would look like specifically for [COMPANY NAME]."*

**Show their likely tier:**
*"Based on [COMPANY] working with [ESTIMATED NUMBER] resellers, you'd likely fit our [RECOMMENDED TIER] plan:"*
- **[TIER NAME]:** €[SETUP COST] setup + €[MONTHLY]/month
- **Time savings for [COMPANY]:** [ESTIMATED HOURS] hours monthly
- **That's [ANNUAL HOURS] hours back to your team annually**

*"Let me show you the math for [COMPANY NAME] specifically:"*

**Personalized ROI calculation:** 
- *"If someone on your [DEPARTMENT] team makes €[ESTIMATED HOURLY RATE]/hour fully loaded"*
- *"And we save [COMPANY] [ESTIMATED HOURS] hours monthly"* 
- *"That's €[MONTHLY SAVINGS] in savings every month"*
- *"Your payback period would be approximately [CALCULATED MONTHS] months"*

*"But here's what's really valuable for [COMPANY] - imagine your [DEPARTMENT] team having those [HOURS] hours back to focus on [STRATEGIC ACTIVITY - e.g., campaign planning, product launches, market expansion] instead of Excel cleanup."*
