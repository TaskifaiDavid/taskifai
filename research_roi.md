Manual Data Cleaning Effort for Reseller Sell-Out Data
Reseller sell-out datasets (with SKUs, product names, quantities, prices, timestamps, retailer info) often suffer “dirty” data – duplicates, inconsistent formats, missing or mis-labeled fields, and pasted data from multiple sources

. Cleaning such data is notoriously labor-intensive. In practice, data teams report that data preparation is one of the most time-consuming parts of analytics

. For example, surveys have cited that data professionals may spend on the order of 50–80% of their time on cleaning and organizing data

. The productivity impact is large: one study noted organizations lose roughly 546 hours per year (total) on fixing bad data

 – much of it in wasted man-hours.) Key data-quality issues in reseller data include missing fields (e.g. blank SKUs or prices), inconsistent naming or units (e.g. “pcs” vs. “each”), duplicate records from repeated imports, typos/mislabeling of products, and misaligned columns from copy/paste. Each issue requires manual detection and correction

. Because of this, even relatively small tables can take many hours to clean. Industry benchmarks and service quotes give a sense of scale:
Per-1,000-row cleaning: Freelance data-entry services routinely quote 2–6 hours to clean up to 1,000 rows of messy spreadsheet data

. (For example, one data-cleaning gig lists 2 hours of work to standardize 1,000 rows with ~15 columns
fiverr.com
.) These tasks typically involve de-duplication, formatting, and filling obvious gaps.
Per-10,000-row cleaning: Scaling up, cleaning 10,000 rows can range from a few dozen hours to over one hundred hours. Enterprise estimates support this magnitude. For instance, Verusen (an inventory-data company) cites $5,000–$15,000 for a 10,000‑row data-cleansing project
verusen.com
. At typical analyst rates (~$90–150/hour

), that implies on the order of 50–150 hours of manual work. (A moderate workload might be ~20–60 hours, while highly messy data could push well over 100 hours.)
Per-100,000-row cleaning: Extrapolating further, 100,000 rows of similar complexity can take hundreds of hours. A rough linear scale suggests 200–1,000+ hours of effort, depending on quality. In practice, truly messy large datasets often trigger automated tools or specialist teams, but the manual-cleaning effort can still stretch into the high hundreds of hours.
These figures assume manual processes (e.g. Excel, OpenRefine, custom scripting). Using specialized tools or AI can cut this dramatically, but the table below focuses on human labor time.
Data Volume	Estimated Manual Cleaning Time (hrs)
~1,000 rows	2 – 6 hours

fiverr.com
~10,000 rows	20 – 150 hours
verusen.com
boisestate.edu
~100,000 rows	200 – 1,000+ hours (hundreds of hours)

Notes: These are broad ranges. The low end assumes minor cleanup (mostly formatting/duplicates), consistent with small‑job quotes

. The high end covers very messy, heterogeneous data. For 10k rows, the high end aligns with Verusen’s cited cost ($15K ≈ 150 h at ~$100/h)

. For 100k rows, manual cleanup can easily become multiple person-months if done thoroughly. In summary, manual cleaning of messy reseller data typically scales steeply with size and messiness. A team averaging ~$50–100/hour of labor would incur roughly $100–$500 to clean 1,000 rows, $1,000–$10,000 for 10,000 rows, and $10,000+ for 100,000 rows of dirty data.
