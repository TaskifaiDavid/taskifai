# UI Fixing Loop

## Step 1
Step 1 is to take a screenshot of each screen in question using the Playwright MCP.

## Step 2

Step 2, reference the directory `/style-guides/` and find the files `style_guide_taskifai.md` and `ux-rules-taskifai.md`.

Based on those files, you are to grade the outputs of Step 1 objectively against that standard, and give your response on a scale of 1 to 10.

## Step 3
For any screens or components that have a score less than 8 out of 10, you must make changes, and then repeat from Step 1.
