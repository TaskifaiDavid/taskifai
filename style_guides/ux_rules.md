# TaskifAI — UX Rules

**Navigation**
- Keep global navigation consistent across all pages.
- Use a sticky navbar with clear CTAs (primary action always visible).
- Use max 5–6 top‑level nav items. Anything else goes under “More” or footer links.

**Hierarchy & Scannability**
- One main idea per section. Each page should be skimmable in under 30 seconds.
- Headlines max 7 words. Subheads max 2 lines.
- Use whitespace generously to separate content blocks.

**CTAs (Calls to Action)**
- Always present a primary CTA above the fold (e.g., “Book a demo”).
- Each page should end with a clear CTA block.
- Limit to 1–2 CTAs per section to avoid choice overload.

**Forms & Inputs**
- Keep forms minimal (name + email + company as default).
- Show progress for multi‑step forms (e.g., signup, onboarding).
- Provide inline error messages and success confirmations.

**Motion & Feedback**
- Use micro‑interactions: hover states, button press feedback, loading spinners.
- Use smooth transitions for dropdowns, modals, and tooltips.
- Respect user preferences with `prefers-reduced-motion`.

**Responsiveness**
- Mobile‑first layout: stack sections vertically with clear CTA.
- Navigation collapses to hamburger menu under 768px.
- Tables → card layouts on small screens.

**Trust & Proof**
- Always show recognizable client logos in grayscale for social proof.
- Case studies should include a quantifiable result (e.g., “95% less manual work”).
- Add security badges (GDPR, encryption, compliance) in footer or trust bars.

**Consistency**
- Reuse components: one button style system‑wide.
- Enforce design tokens for spacing, colors, and typography.
- No ad‑hoc styling; everything must come from the design system.

**Accessibility**
- Meet or exceed WCAG AA.
- Keyboard navigable, clear focus states.
- Alt text for all meaningful images.
- Sufficient contrast for all text, including gradient overlays.

**Performance**
- Aim for Lighthouse score ≥ 95.
- Lazy‑load images and animations.
- Optimize for first interaction under 2 seconds.
