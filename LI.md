We’re live and ready to help brands make sense of reseller data.

A lot of consumer brands still rely on spreadsheets to track sell-out reports from their resellers. Some have a few partners. Others have dozens or more. Managing all that data is a lot of manual work.

The same problems keep coming up:
-Different spreadsheet layout from every reseller
-Product names and categories that aren’t consistent
-Hours of manual cleaning

At TaskifAI, we’ve built a platform that takes all of those reports and turns them into clean, reliable insights.

Here’s how it works:
-Spreadsheets gets uploaded in your custom built portal
-The system automatically cleans and organizes everything
-Dashboards gets updated
-Teams can ask questions like “What sold best in France last month?” and get a clear answer

This means no more manual data cleanup and no more uncertainty. You get clear answers on what’s selling, where it’s working, and what needs your attention.

We’re ready to help more brands take control of their sell-out data. If this sounds like something your team deals with, send us a message and we’ll show you how it works.
